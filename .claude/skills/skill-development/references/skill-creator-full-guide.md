## What Skills Provide

1. **Specialized workflows** — Multi-step procedures for specific domains
2. **Tool integrations** — Instructions for working with specific file formats or APIs
3. **Domain expertise** — Company-specific knowledge, schemas, business logic
4. **Bundled resources** — Scripts, references, and assets for complex and repetitive tasks

## Bundled Resource Details

### Scripts (`scripts/`)

Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.) for tasks that require deterministic reliability or are repeatedly rewritten.

- **When to include**: When the same code is being rewritten repeatedly or deterministic reliability is needed
- **Example**: `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` for PDF rotation tasks
- **Benefits**: Token efficient, deterministic, may be executed without loading into context
- **Note**: Scripts may still need to be read by Claude for patching or environment-specific adjustments

### References (`references/`)

Documentation and reference material intended to be loaded as needed into context.

- **When to include**: For documentation that Claude should reference while working
- **Examples**: `references/finance.md` for financial schemas, `references/api_docs.md` for API specifications
- **Use cases**: Database schemas, API documentation, domain knowledge, company policies, detailed workflow guides
- **Benefits**: Keeps SKILL.md lean, loaded only when Claude determines it's needed
- **Best practice**: If files are large (>10k words), include grep search patterns in SKILL.md
- **Avoid duplication**: Information should live in either SKILL.md or references files, not both

### Assets (`assets/`)

Files not intended to be loaded into context, but rather used within the output Claude produces.

- **When to include**: When the skill needs files that will be used in the final output
- **Examples**: `assets/logo.png` for brand assets, `assets/slides.pptx` for PowerPoint templates, `assets/frontend-template/` for HTML/React boilerplate
- **Use cases**: Templates, images, icons, boilerplate code, fonts, sample documents that get copied or modified
- **Benefits**: Separates output resources from documentation, enables Claude to use files without loading them into context

## Extended Step 1: Understanding with Concrete Examples

To create an effective skill, clearly understand concrete examples of how the skill will be used. This understanding can come from either direct user examples or generated examples validated with user feedback.

For example, when building an image-editor skill, relevant questions include:

- "What functionality should the image-editor skill support? Editing, rotating, anything else?"
- "Can you give some examples of how this skill would be used?"
- "I can imagine users asking for things like 'Remove the red-eye from this image' or 'Rotate this image'. Are there other ways you imagine this skill being used?"
- "What would a user say that should trigger this skill?"

To avoid overwhelming users, avoid asking too many questions in a single message. Start with the most important questions and follow up as needed.

## Extended Step 2: Planning Examples

**PDF Editor skill** — for queries like "Help me rotate this PDF":
1. Rotating a PDF requires re-writing the same code each time
2. A `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` script would be helpful to store in the skill

**Frontend Webapp Builder skill** — for queries like "Build me a todo app":
1. Writing a frontend webapp requires the same boilerplate each time
2. An `assets/hello-world/` template containing boilerplate project files would be helpful

**BigQuery skill** — for queries like "How many users have logged in today?":
1. Querying BigQuery requires re-discovering table schemas each time
2. A `references/schema.md` file documenting the table schemas would be helpful

**Hooks skill** — for queries like "Create a PreToolUse hook":
1. Developers repeatedly need to validate hooks.json and test hook scripts
2. `scripts/validate-hook-schema.sh` and `scripts/test-hook.sh` utilities would be helpful
3. `references/patterns.md` for detailed hook patterns to avoid bloating SKILL.md

## Plugin-Specific Considerations

### Skill Location in Plugins

```
my-plugin/
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── plugin.json
├── commands/
├── agents/
└── skills/
    └── my-skill/
        ├── SKILL.md
        ├── references/
        ├── examples/
        └── scripts/
```

### Auto-Discovery

Claude Code automatically discovers skills:
- Scans `skills/` directory
- Finds subdirectories containing `SKILL.md`
- Loads skill metadata (name + description) always
- Loads SKILL.md body when skill triggers
- Loads references/examples when needed

### Testing in Plugins

```bash
# Test with --plugin-dir
cc --plugin-dir /path/to/plugin

# Ask questions that should trigger the skill
# Verify skill loads correctly
```

## Skill Templates

### Minimal Skill

```
skill-name/
└── SKILL.md
```

Good for: Simple knowledge, no complex resources needed.

### Standard Skill (Recommended)

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md
├── references/
│   └── detailed-guide.md
└── examples/
    └── working-example.sh
```

Good for: Most skills with detailed documentation.

### Complete Skill

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md
├── references/
│   ├── patterns.md
│   └── advanced.md
├── examples/
│   ├── example1.sh
│   └── example2.json
└── scripts/
    └── validate.sh
```

Good for: Complex domains with validation utilities.

## Writing Style — Extended Examples

### Imperative/Infinitive Form

**Correct (imperative):**
```
To create a hook, define the event type.
Configure the MCP server with authentication.
Validate settings before use.
```

**Incorrect (second person):**
```
You should create a hook by defining the event type.
You need to configure the MCP server.
You must validate settings before use.
```

### Third-Person in Description

**Correct:**
```yaml
description: This skill should be used when the user asks to "create X", "configure Y"...
```

**Incorrect:**
```yaml
description: Use this skill when you want to create X...
description: Load when user needs hook help.
description: Provides hook guidance.
```

### Objective, Instructional Language

**Correct:**
```
Parse the frontmatter using sed.
Extract fields with grep.
Validate values before use.
```

**Incorrect:**
```
You can parse the frontmatter...
Claude should extract fields...
The user might validate values...
```

## Reference Skills (Anthropic Examples)
